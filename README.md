# Python Password Generator

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klugjo/hexo-autolinker.svg?branch=master)

Python password generator that includes a mix of the list used each time the program is executed.
There are two versions of the python password generator:

    pwdGen.py - generates a complex password with a single mix of the characters list
  
    pwdGenMixer.py - generates a complex password after asking user how many times to 
                       mix the characters list for higher randmization

Both programs ask for length of password wanted while the first mixes the character list just
once while the second depending on input, can mix the characters list 1000 times before creating
the desire password from the characters list.

The aim was to create a password generator with good randomization while using as little code as possible.
